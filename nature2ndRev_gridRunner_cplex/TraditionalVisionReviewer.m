function sbest = TraditionalVision(A)

%% Maximizes x'*A*x/(x'x) where x is a vector of 0 and 1
%% patterned after pseudo code for simulated annealing on wikipedia
%% The input is a symmetric affinity matrix containing non-negative numbers
%% The output is a vector of 0 (non-salient) and 1 (salient) corresponding
%% to the primitives (edge segments), corresponding to the rows of the
%% matrix.
